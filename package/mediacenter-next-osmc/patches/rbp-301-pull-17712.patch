 Before you start coding we advise you to build Kodi's master branch. This will save you and us precious time by making sure a proper build environment is set up and all dependencies are met. For your convenience, **[build guides](README.md)** are available for most common platforms. A **[git guide](GIT-FU.md)** is also available, streamlined to Kodi's development workflow. Unless you're a *git ninja*, please read it carefully.  
 If you are a *git ninja*, we feel happy and sad for you at the same time. Your soul might be lost to the dark side already but worry not, we have cookies!
 
+## Reviews
+Reviews are a great way to get familiar with the codebase. If you would like to start with reviewing just use **[this handy github filter](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+review%3Anone)** to see PRs that are in need of one (we have plenty!).

 ## Pull request guidelines
 * **Create topic branches**. Never ever open a pull request from your master branch. **Ever!**
 * **Code against master branch**. Unless release specific, all Kodi development occurs in the `master` branch. If it needs backporting it can be done after it hits master.
